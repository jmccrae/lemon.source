       lemon source is a space for the collaborative development of ontology-lexica. Here you can upload your lexica and access them from anywhere as well as sharing them with your colleagues. In addition we maintain a set of publically available lexica that can be edited by anyone. To view the set of public lexica click here.

lemon source builds on the lemon model which is a flexible model for creating and sharing lexica on the semantic web and uses the LexInfo model for describing data categories in the model.

In addition lemon source integrates a state-of-the-art automatic system for generating lexica using NLP tools, that allows lemon lexica to be automatically inferred from ontology files specified in OWL. Note that this feature is only available to logged-in users, which is performed by OpenID so you can uses existing accounts for Google or Yahoo.
